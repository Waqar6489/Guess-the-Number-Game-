# Guess-the-Number-Game-
If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower  number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher  number please” When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the  number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
